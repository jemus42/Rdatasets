<h2>&quot;Let Them Watch TV&quot;</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>&quot;Let Them Watch TV&quot;: These data contain price indices for various items for the general
urban consumer. Categories include medical services, college tuition, college textbooks,
child care, housing, food and beverages, all items (i.e. general CPI),
new vehicles, apparel, and televisions. The base period in value was originally
the 1982-4 average, but I converted the base period to January 2000. I use these
data for in-class discussion about how liberalized trade has made consumer
electronics (like TVs) fractions of their past prices. Yet, young adults face
mounting costs for college, child-raising, and health care that government
policy has failed to address.
