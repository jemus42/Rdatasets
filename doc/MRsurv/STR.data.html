<h2>
These data were extracted from the DIVAT data bank for second kidney transplant recipients.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data were extracted from the DIVAT cohort. It corresponds to the relative sample constituted by second transplant recipients (STR). 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(FTR.data)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with the 6 following variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Tps.Evt</code></dt><dd><p>This numeric vector provides the post transplantation time (in days).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Evt</code></dt><dd><p>This vector provides the indicators of graft failure at the end of the follow-up (1 for failures and 0 for right censoring).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ageR2cl</code></dt><dd><p>This numeric vector provides the recipient age at transplantation (1 for older than 55 years and 0 otherwise).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sexeR</code></dt><dd><p>This numeric vector provides the recipient gender (1 for men and 0 for women).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ageD2cl</code></dt><dd><p>This numeric vector provides the donor age (1 for older than 55 years and 0 otherwise).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Tattente2cl</code></dt><dd><p>This numeric vector provides the waiting time in dialysis between the two consecutive transplantations (1 for more than 3 years and 0 otherwise).</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Second transplant recipients (STR) constituted the relative group of interest. Recipients older than 18 years at the date of transplantation between 1996 and 2010 were selected from the French DIVAT (www.divat.fr/en) multicentric prospective cohort. Only recipients with a maintenance therapy with calcineurin inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors or belatacept, in addition to mycophenolic acid and steroid were included. Simultaneous transplantations were excluded. Two explicative variables are common with the reference group: recipient age at transplantation and recipient gender. Two explicative variables are specific to STR: donor age and waiting time in dialysis between the two consecutive transplantations.
