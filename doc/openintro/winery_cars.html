<h2>Time Between Gondola Cars at Sterling Winery</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These times represent times between gondolas at Sterling Winery. The main
take-away: there are 7 cars, as evidenced by the somewhat regular increases
in splits between every 7 cars. The reason the times are slightly
non-constant is that the gondolas come off the tracks, so times will change
a little between each period.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
winery_cars
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 52 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>obs_number</dt><dd><p>The observation number, e.g. observation 3 was immediately
preceded by observation 2.</p>
</dd>
<dt>time_until_next</dt><dd><p>Time until this gondola car arrived since the last
car had left.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Important context: there was a sufficient line that people were leaving the
winery.
</p>
<p>So why is this data valuable? It indicates that the winery should add one
more car since it has a lot of time wasted every 7th car. By adding another
car, fewer visitors are likely to be turned away, resulting in increased
revenue.
