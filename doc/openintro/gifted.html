&quot;mummy&quot; or &quot;daddy&quot;, age in month when the child first counted to 10
successfully, average number of hours per week the child's mother or father
reads to the child, average number of hours per week the child watched an
educational program on TV during the past three months, average number of
hours per week the child watched cartoons on TV during the past three
months. The analytical skills are evaluated using a standard testing
