<h2>Pew Research Center poll on health care, including question variants</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For example, Pew Research Center conducted a survey with the following
question: &quot;As you may know, by 2014 nearly all Americans will be required to
have health insurance. People who do not buy insurance will pay a penalty
while people who cannot afford it will receive financial help from the
government. Do you approve or disapprove of this policy?&quot; For each randomly
sampled respondent, the statements in brackets were randomized: either they
were kept in the order given above, or the two statements were reversed.
