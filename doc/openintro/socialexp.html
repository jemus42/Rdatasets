<h2>Social experiment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A &quot;social experiment&quot; conducted by a TV program questioned what people do
when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her
boyfriend. On two different occasions at the same restaurant, the same
couple was depicted. In one scenario the woman was dressed &quot;provocatively&quot;
and in the other scenario the woman was dressed &quot;conservatively&quot;. The table
below shows how many restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and
whether or not they intervened.
