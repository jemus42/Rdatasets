<h2>US births</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Every year, the US releases to the public a large data set containing
information on births recorded in the country. This data set has been of
interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits
and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. This is a
random sample of 1,000 cases from the data set released in 2014.
