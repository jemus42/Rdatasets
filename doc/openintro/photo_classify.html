<h2>Photo classifications: fashion or not</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a simulated data set for photo classifications based on a machine
learning algorithm versus what the true classification is for those photos.
While the data are not real, they resemble performance that would be
reasonable to expect in a well-built classifier.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
photo_classify
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1822 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>mach_learn</dt><dd><p>The prediction by the machine learning system as to whether the photo is about fashion or not.</p>
</dd>
<dt>truth</dt><dd><p>The actual classification of the photo by a team of humans.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The hypothetical ML algorithm has a precision of 90\
photos it claims are fashion, about 90\
The recall of the ML algorithm is about 64\
about fashion, it correctly predicts that they are about fashion about 64\
of the time.

<h3>Source</h3>
