<h2>Type 2 Diabetes Clinical Trial for Patients 10-17 Years Old</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Three treatments were compared to test their relative efficacy
(effectiveness) in treating Type 2 Diabetes in patients aged 10-17 who were
being treated with metformin. The primary outcome was lack of glycemic
control (or not); lacking glycemic control means the patient still needed
insulin, which is not the preferred outcome for a patient.
