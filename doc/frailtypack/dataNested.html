<h2>Simulated data with two levels of grouping</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This contains a simulated sample of 400 observations which allow
establishing 20 clusters with 4 subgroups and 5 subjects in each subgroup,
in order to obtain two levels of grouping. This data set is useful to
illustrate how to fit a nested model. Two independent gamma frailty
parameters with a variance fixed at 0.1 for the cluster effect and at 0.5
for the subcluster effect were generated. Independent survival times were
generated from a simple Weibull baseline risk function. The percentage of
censoring data was around 30 per cent. The right-censoring variables were
generated from a uniform distribution on [1,36] and a left-truncating
variable was generated with a uniform distribution on [0,10]. Observations
were included only if the survival time is greater than the truncated time.
